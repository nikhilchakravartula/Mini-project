# Operating system task scheduler for multi-core architectures
This project is our proposal for Operating System Task Scheduler for Multicore architectures. 
This was done long back and at that point of time, owing to the deadline, we did not add comments to the code. Regret the incovenience. 
Please see main() in scheduler.c. Running it should be self-explanatory. For more details, please refer to [ProjectDocumentation](https://github.com/nikhilchakravartula/Mini-project/blob/master/ProjectDocument.pdf)
